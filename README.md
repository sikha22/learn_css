<h1 style="color:blue;text decoration:underline;"><b><i><center>GLOBAL WARMING</center></i></b></h1>
<p><b><BLINK>Global warming</BLINK></b> the phenomenon of increasing average air temperatures near 
the surface of Earth over the past one to two centuries. 
Climate scientists have since the mid-20th century<br> gathered detailed observations of 
various <abbr title ="such as temperatures, precipitation,and storms">weather phenomean </abbr> and 
of related influences on climate such as<q> ocean currents and the atmosphere’s 
chemical composition.</q> These data indicate that Earth’s climate has changed over
almost every conceivable timescale since the beginning of geologic time and that
the influence of human&nbsp;activities since at least the beginning of the
Industrial Revolution has been deeply woven into the very fabric of climate change.</p>

<p>As the Earth's surface temperature becomes hotter the sea level becomes higher.
This is partly because water over 4 °C (7.2 °F) expands when it gets warmer.<br> It is also partly because warm temperatures make glaciers and ice caps melt. 
The sea level rise causes coastal areas to flood. Weather patterns, including where and how much rain or <br>snow there is, are changing. Deserts will probably increase in size. Colder areas will warm up faster
than warm areas. Strong storms may become more likely and farming may not make as much food. These effects will not be the same everywhere. The changes from one area to another are not well known.</p>

<h2 style="color:green;text decoration:underline;"><b><i><center>CAUSES OF GLOBAL WARMING</center></i></b></h2>
<ol>
<li>FOSSIL FUELS</li>
<li>DEFORESTATION</li>
<li>INTENSIVE FARMING</li>
<li>WASTE DISPOSAL</li>
<li>MINING</li>
<li>OVERCONSUMPTION</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>FOSSIL FUELS</b></h3>
<p>The massive use of fossil fuels is obviously the
first source of global warming, as burning coal, oil and gas produces <br>carbon dioxide - the most important greenhouse gas in the atmosphere - as well as
nitrous oxide.</p>

<h4><b>DEFORESTATION</b></h4>
<p>The exploitation of forests has a major role in climate change. <br>Trees help regulate the climate by absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere. When they are cut down, 
this positive effect is lost and the carbon stored in the trees is released into the atmosphere.</p>

<h5><b>INTENSIVE FARMING</b></h5>
<p>Another cause of global warming is intensive farming, not only with<br> the ever-increasing livestock, but also with plant protection products and fertilizers. 
In fact, cattle and sheep produce large amounts of methane when digesting their food, while fertilizers produce nitrous oxide emissions.</p>

<h6><b>WASTE DISPOSAL</b></h6>
<p>Waste management methods like landfills and incineration emit<br> greenhouse and toxic gases - including methane - that are released
 into the atmosphere, soil and waterways, contributing to the increase of the greenhouse effect.</p>

<h7><b>MINING</b></h7>
<p>Modern life is highly dependent on the mining and metallurgical industry. <br>Metals and minerals are the raw materials used in the construction, 
transportation and manufacturing of goods. From extraction to delivery, 
this market accounts for 5% of all greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<h8><b>OVER COMSUMPTION</b></h8>
<p>Finally, overconsumption also plays a major role in climate change. <br>In fact, it is responsible for the overexploitation of natural resources
 and emissions from international freight transport, which both contribute to global warming.</p>
